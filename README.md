# Flatbread

2D gameengine based on Bagel Engine.

Bagel Engine is 'how cool of a thing I can make with libraries' whereas Flatbread is 'how much can I make with minimum libraries'. 
This means there will be no entt no jolt nor imgui. I am still using glfw, vulkan, and an image library. 
This engine is where I apply what I learned from building Bagel engine.

Initial commit is done right after implementing gamestate serialization and deserialization. While getting things done quickly is fun, working on this made me realize going into the nittygritty of systems is also fun.
